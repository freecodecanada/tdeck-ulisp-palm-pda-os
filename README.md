# tdeck-ulisp-palm-pda-os
Palm-style PDA OS running inside uLisp on the LilyGO T-Deck: boot screen, simple menus, app runner, system tools (battery, save/load, reboot), and a Notes app. Built for safe serial pasting in tiny blocks. Huge credit to uLisp.com for the language + docs. To run the OS you must first install http://www.ulisp.com/show?4JAO
